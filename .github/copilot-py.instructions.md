# Instructions to write Python code

- Use snake_case for variable and function names, and PascalCase for class names.
- Always use double quotes for the strings and use a newline at the end of the file.
- To concatenate a string, always use f-strings (formatted string literals).
- Whenever it is possible, use list and dictionary comprehensions to create lists and dictionaries in a more concise way.
- Always add types to the first declaration of a variable and the function parameters and return types.
- Use the `with` statement to handle resource management, such as file operations, to ensure proper cleanup.
- Add the docstrings to the functions and classes to describe their purpose and usage.
- Use the `if __name__ == "__main__":` construct to allow or prevent parts of code from being run when the modules are imported.
- Take advantage of the truthy and falsy values in Python to simplify conditions. For example, instead of checking if a variable is not `None`, you can simply check if it is truthy.
- Follow the PEP 8 style guide for Python code, which includes guidelines for naming conventions, indentation, line length, and more.
